## Minimising bird collisions with wind turbines 

Wind power is an essential part of efforts to reduce reliance on fossil fuels to tackle climate change. However, the growth in size of wind turbines and scale of windfarms poses collision risks for birds, especially seabirds offshore and raptors on shore. It is thought that birds find it hard to see moving turbines. Researchers iat Smøla Vindkraftverk in Norway tested whether passive visual cues would make turbine motion more visible by painting one of the turbines black. They found that annual mortality was reduced by 70% compared to unpainted nearby control areas.
