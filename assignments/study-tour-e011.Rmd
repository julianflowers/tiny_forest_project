## Minimising bird collisions with wind turbines

Wind power is an essential part of efforts to reduce reliance on fossil fuels to tackle climate change. However, the growth in size of wind turbines and scale of windfarms poses collision risks for birds, especially seabirds offshore and raptors on shore. It is thought that birds find it hard to see moving turbines. Researchers iat Sm√∏la Vindkraftverk in Norway tested whether passive visual cues would make turbine motion more visible by painting one of the turbines black. They found that annual mortality was reduced by 70% compared to unpainted nearby control areas.

## Crumbling coastlines

Happisburgh is one of a number of places on England's North Sea coast where coastal erosion is damaging housing and infrastructure and threatening coastal villages and communities. A major contributor to erosion is storm surges when large storms and high tides combine. A recent modelling study of extreme storm surge risk and projections in the North Sea has found that climate change is increasing both mean sea level and storm intensity and is likely to generate more frequent major surges in the future.

## Tree diseases spread as climate changes

Red-band pine needle disease is caused by a fungus called *Dothistroma septasporum* which damages the leaves and prevents photosynthesis. It has devastated Thetford Forest over the last two decades because it particularly effects Corsican pines which constitute over half of the 25,000 Ha of trees. This has necessitated mass felling and diversification of planting. Prior to the 1990s it rarely caused outbreaks in the Northern Hemisphere and French researchers have found that reduction in summer precipitation increases tree stress making them more suspectible to infection, and warming temperatures allows fungal pathogens to spread, increasing the likelihood of exposure of this and many fungal infections posing ongoing risks to UK pine forests.

## Climate warming impacts on egg laying of great tits

Climate warming can have differential effects on the timing of seasonal natural events. In Monks Wood, the time of first egg laying of blue and great tits has been studied for 23 years in relation to climate events. Tits lay their eggs earlier when spring temperatures are higher, and spring temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere are influenced by a climatic phenomenon known as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) which is a measure of the differences in air pressure between the Azores and the Icelandic low pressure system. There is evidence that this has been increasing due to climate change, in turn increasing spring temperatures, and impacting bird phenology.

## Poleward movement of dragonflies

One consequence of global warming is the range expansion of many species towards the poles. In Europe many species are moving north and being seen in Britain for the first time or establishing breeding populations. Dragonfly distribution is sensitive to temperature because it impacts on habitat and food, reproductive and physiological processes and the aquatic stages of their life cycle. In Britain, several species are now being recorded for the first time and being seen further north than in the past.
