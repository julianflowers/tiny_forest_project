@BOOK{Henderson2021-yr,
  title     = "Southwood's Ecological Methods",
  author    = "Henderson, Peter A",
  abstract  = "Ecological Methods by the late T.R. E. Southwood and revised
               over the years by P. A. Henderson has developed into a classic
               reference work for the field biologist. It provides a handbook
               of ecological methods and analytical techniques pertinent to the
               study of animals, with an emphasis onnon-microscopic animals in
               both terrestrial and aquatic environments. It remains unique in
               the breadth of the methods presented and in the depth of the
               literature cited, stretching right back to the earliest days of
               ecological research. The universal availability of R as an open
               source package has radically changed the way ecologists analyse
               their data. In response, Southwood's classic text has been
               thoroughly revised to be more relevant and useful to a new
               generation of ecologists, making the vast resource of R packages
               morereadily available to the wider ecological community. By
               focusing on the use of R for data analysis, supported by worked
               examples, the book is now more accessible than previous editions
               to students requiring support and ideas for their projects.
               Southwood's Ecological Methods provides a crucial resource for
               both graduate students and research scientists in applied
               ecology, wildlife ecology, fisheries, agriculture, conservation
               biology, and habitat ecology. It will also be useful to the many
               professional ecologists, wildlife biologists, conservation
               biologists and practitioners requiring an authoritative overview
               of ecological methodology.",

@ARTICLE{Aerts2018-qb,
  title    = "Biodiversity and human health: mechanisms and evidence of the
              positive health effects of diversity in nature and green spaces",
  author   = "Aerts, Raf and Honnay, Olivier and Van Nieuwenhuyse, An",
  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Natural environments and green spaces provide
              ecosystem services that enhance human health and well-being. They
              improve mental health, mitigate allergies and reduce all-cause,
              respiratory, cardiovascular and cancer mortality. The presence,
              accessibility, proximity and greenness of green spaces determine
              the magnitude of their positive health effects, but the role of
              biodiversity (including species and ecosystem diversity) within
              green spaces remains underexplored. This review describes
              mechanisms and evidence of effects of biodiversity in nature and
              green spaces on human health. SOURCES OF DATA: We identified
              studies listed in PubMed and Web of Science using combinations of
              keywords including 'biodiversity', 'diversity', 'species
              richness', 'human health', 'mental health' and 'well-being' with
              no restrictions on the year of publication. Papers were
              considered for detailed evaluation if they were written in
              English and reported data on levels of biodiversity and health
              outcomes. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: There is evidence for positive
              associations between species diversity and well-being
              (psychological and physical) and between ecosystem diversity and
              immune system regulation. AREAS OF CONCERN: There is a very
              limited number of studies that relate measured biodiversity to
              human health. There is more evidence for self-reported
              psychological well-being than for well-defined clinical outcomes.
              High species diversity has been associated with both reduced and
              increased vector-borne disease risk. GROWING POINTS: Biodiversity
              supports ecosystem services mitigating heat, noise and air
              pollution, which all mediate the positive health effects of green
              spaces, but direct and long-term health outcomes of species
              diversity have been insufficiently studied so far. AREAS TIMELY
              FOR RESEARCH: Additional research and newly developed methods are
              needed to quantify short- and long-term health effects of
              exposure to perceived and objectively measured species diversity,
              including health effects of nature-based solutions and exposure
              to microbiota.",
